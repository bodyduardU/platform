# Reducers

Reducers are pure functions that are used in Store to handle state changes. These reducer functions are called with each dispatched action and the current or initial state and return a new immutable state. Reducers use switch statements in combination with TypeScript's discriminated unions defined in your actions to provide type-safe processing of actions in a reducer.
