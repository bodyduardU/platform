# V10 Update Guide

## Angular CLI update

NgRx supports using the Angular CLI `ng update` command to update your dependencies. Migration schematics are run to make the upgrade smoother. These schematics will fix some of the breaking changes.

To update your packages to the latest released version, run the command below.

```sh
ng update @ngrx/store
```

## Dependencies

Version 10 has the minimum version requirements:

- Angular version 10.x
- Angular CLI version 10.x
- TypeScript version 3.9.x
- RxJS version 6.5.x

## Breaking changes
